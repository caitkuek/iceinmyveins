# ice in my veins

## Overview 
A database-like app using Vite, with data fetched from balldontlie API (https://www.balldontlie.io/).

The app functions as a simple kind of information database for the NBA - the teams, players and games played each season. Take a look here: iceinmyveins.vercel.app


### User Stories

As a user I want to:

* See teams - city, division & conference
* See and search players- team, position, season averages (if possible)
* See games - team vs team, scores, season


## Most difficult part of the project
The most difficult part of the project was getting the players search to pull out the player card as well as the respective player's season averages as they were split in different databases.


## Favourite part of the project



## WIP 
- Working on a PVP search: potentially with charts
